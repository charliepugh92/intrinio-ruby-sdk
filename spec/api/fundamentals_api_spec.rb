#Intrinio API

#Welcome to the Intrinio API! Through our Marketplace, we offer a wide selection of financial data feeds sourced by our own proprietary processes as well as from many data vendors. The primary application of the Intrinio API is for use in third-party applications and integrations or for end-users utilizing the Excel add-in and Google Sheets add-on. The Intrinio API uses HTTPS verbs and a RESTful endpoint structure, which makes it easy to request data from Intrinio. Responses are delivered in JSON format. If you need additional help in using the API, go to our home page (https://intrinio.com) and click on the chat icon in the lower right corner.

  # unit tests for get_fundamental_standardized_financials
  # Get Standardized Financials for a Fundamental
  # Returns professional-grade historical financial data. This data is standardized, cleansed and verified to ensure the highest quality data sourced directly from the XBRL financial statements. The primary purpose of standardized financials are to facilitate comparability across a single companyâ€™s fundamentals and across all companies fundamentals. For example, it is possible to compare total revenues between two companies as of a certain point in time, or within a single company across multiple time periods. This is not possible using the as reported financial statements because of the inherent complexity of reporting standards.
